Reports:
- mandelbrot: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange and SIMD directive (for outer loop).
- mandelbrot1: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange and SIMD directive (for outer loop).
- mandelbrot2: nothing is vectorized and suggests SIMD directive (for both outer loops).
- mandelbrot3: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange (between the two inner ones) [not to do because it's not worth it] and SIMD directive (for both outer loops) [as tested in mandelbrot7b it's not worth it].
- mandelbrot4: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange (between the two inner ones) [not to do because it's not worth it] and SIMD directive (for both outer loops) [as tested in mandelbrot7b it's not worth it].
- mandelbrot5: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange (between the two inner ones) [not to do because it's not worth it] and SIMD directive (for both outer loops) [as tested in mandelbrot7b it's not worth it].
- mandelbrot6: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange (between the two inner ones) [not to do because it's not worth it] and SIMD directive (for both outer loops) [as tested in mandelbrot7b it's not worth it].
- mandelbrot7: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange (between the two inner ones) [not to do because it's not worth it] and SIMD directive (for both outer loops) [as tested in mandelbrot7b it's not worth it].
- mandelbrot8a: nothing is vectorized, suggests loop interchange (between the two inner ones) [not to do because it's not worth it] and SIMD directive (for both outer loops) [as tested in mandelbrot7b it's not worth it].
